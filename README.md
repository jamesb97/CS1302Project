# CS1302 Semester Project

Programming Principles II Course Project.<br />
The purpose of this project is to create an animated connect four game which graphically shows the game board and tokens. Each token is animated when the player drops a token in between columns 0 to 5. If a player wins, the game animates the winner by flashing the winning tokens.
